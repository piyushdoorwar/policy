<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<h2>1. Scope of This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications, games, and related software products
developed and published by the developer, across all supported platforms.
</p>

<p>
By using any of the applications, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
The applications do <strong>not collect, transmit, process, or store</strong> any personal,
sensitive, biometric, financial, or identifiable user data.
</p>

<p>
No accounts, profiles, logins, or user identifiers are required to use the applications.
</p>

<h2>3. Local Device Storage</h2>
<p>
The applications may store limited, non-personal data locally on your device, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Game progress</li>
  <li>High scores</li>
  <li>Game settings and preferences (for example, sound or difficulty settings)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remains entirely on the user’s device</li>
  <li>Is not transmitted to any external servers</li>
  <li>Is not accessible by the developer</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Internet and Network Usage</h2>
<p>
The applications are designed to function fully offline.
</p>

<p>
No internet connection is required for gameplay. Any internet access (if available on the device)
is outside the control of the application and the developer.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The applications do <strong>not</strong> integrate with or depend on:
</p>

  <li>Advertising networks</li>
  <li>Analytics platforms</li>
  <li>Tracking SDKs</li>
  <li>Social media services</li>
  <li>External APIs or cloud services</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The applications are suitable for users of all ages.
</p>

<p>
No personal data is knowingly collected from children or adults.
Because no personal data is collected at all, there is no risk of misuse or exposure of children’s data.
</p>

<h2>7. User Responsibility and Health Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
The applications are provided for entertainment purposes only.
</p>

<p>
The developer is not responsible for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Excessive usage or prolonged screen time</li>
  <li>Any physical, mental, or emotional effects resulting from gameplay</li>
  <li>Distraction, fatigue, or dependency arising from use of the applications</li>
</ul>

<p>
Users are encouraged to take breaks and use the applications responsibly.
</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
The applications are provided on an <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong> basis.
</p>

<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developer shall not be liable for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any direct or indirect damages arising from use or inability to use the applications</li>
  <li>Loss of data, progress, or device-specific information</li>
  <li>Device malfunctions, performance issues, or incompatibilities</li>
  <li>Any consequences resulting from misuse or unintended use</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. External Environment Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
The developer does not control the operating system, device manufacturer,
app distribution platform, or network environment.
</p>

<p>
Any issues arising from device behavior, system updates, third-party software,
or platform policies are outside the responsibility of the developer.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in features,
legal requirements, or development practices.
</p>

<p>
Continued use of the applications after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
</p>

<h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
